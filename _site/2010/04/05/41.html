      <p>There is a crack, in the walls of my mind, through which I can peer at the past.</p>
<p>The hole is very small, but I can still see the open fields and meadows, and myself and my lover.</p>
<p>I stare through the hole to pass the time. To try and feel, and understand, what I will never understand.</p>
<p>Why is something so good, so perilous? I watch in fear as they skip around perilous chasms. Despite already knowing how and when it will end.</p>
<p>I tell myself, to maintain love, you much feel like it will never end. It may waiver. It may crack. But no one knows why and when. And where.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s better not to imagine things that never were. Or that don&#8217;t last very long. Given the chance, I would gladly try again.</p>
<p>I can remember the stress, that led me to extinguish the flame. The point at which I could no longer return to her, and look her in the eye. When I no longer wanted to hear her voice.</p>
<p>While in my cell I wonder: who holds the record for love? I suppose there are quite a few, that manage to kindle it for years and years. For whom death can&#8217;t even steal their prize. At least that&#8217;s what we may believe.</p>
