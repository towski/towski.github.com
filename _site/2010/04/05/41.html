      <p>There is a crack in the walls of my mind, through which I can peer at the past.</p>
<p>The hole is very small, but I can still see the open fields and meadows, and myself and my lover.</p>
<p>I stare through the hole to pass the time. To feel revurburations, and think.</p>
<p>Why is something so good, so perilous? I watch in fear as they skip around chasms despite already knowing how and when it will end.</p>
<p>To maintain love, you must feel like it will never end. It may waiver. It may crack. But no one knows when and where.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s better not to imagine things so ephemeral. Given the chance, I would try again.</p>
<p>I can remember the stress, that led me to extinguish the flame. The point at which I could no longer return to her, and look her in the eye. When I no longer wanted to hear her voice.</p>
<p>While in my cell I wonder: who holds the record for love? I suppose there are quite a few, that manage to kindle it for years and years. From whom death can&#8217;t even steal their prize. At least that&#8217;s what we can believe.</p>
