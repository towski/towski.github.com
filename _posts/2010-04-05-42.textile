Technology buzzes without stopping, while the body glides through space without a sound. Our hearts are unadapted to the simple causality of our minds. 

Minds that try to understand what took away their essential joy. Joy that springs simply from being. Joy that sometimes has no reason.

You must be careful, and keep your body a secret. For many seek to destroy from behind red curtains, the unprepared animal.

The graceful flight of an untamed bird, stopping to enjoy its last meal. 

The simple eyes of those too naive to understand.

Existence constricts and bends, as we morph around each other. Zapped by our constraints, fluid otherwise.

All places become cages, unless we move elsewhere

Just as a trophy lies where once was a great movement.
