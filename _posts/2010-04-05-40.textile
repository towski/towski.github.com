You had seen deceit, when your children took your power, clamored for their own time, refused to hear you, and preferred new conquest to the father that guarded them.

Like demons they push forth, trying their new limits, discovering their new rivals. 

Sometimes deceit is inevitable. Children grow to become our burdens, and then our destroyers. Disrespect controls us, keeps us in fear of confrontation. Stone cracks where the cement bonds become too strong, hearts break only to be resolidified. 

Death looms over our heads. Every mistake we make was an opportunity lost. For reconciliation. For peace. For hope. 

Truth remains unimportant to those without it.
