title: Peering through the hole

There is a crack in the walls of my mind, through which I can peer at the past. 

The hole is very small, but I can still see the open fields and meadows, and myself and my lover.

I stare through the hole to pass the time. To feel revurburations, and think.

Why is something so good, so perilous? I watch in fear as they skip around chasms despite already knowing how and when it will end.

To maintain love, you must feel like it will never end. It may waiver. It may crack. But no one knows when and where.

Perhaps it's better not to imagine things so ephemeral. Given the chance, I would try again. 

I can remember the stress, that led me to extinguish the flame. The point at which I could no longer return to her, and look her in the eye. When I no longer wanted to hear her voice. 

While in my cell I wonder: who holds the record for love? I suppose there are quite a few, that manage to kindle it for years and years. From whom death can't even steal their prize. At least that's what we can believe.
